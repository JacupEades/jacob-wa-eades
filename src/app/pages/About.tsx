        Hi! I&#39;m Jacob Eades <br />
        <span>Software Engineer</span>
        <br />
        I&#39;m a self-taught <span>Full-Stack Developer</span> with a unique
        background as a<span>Master Electrician</span>. I had some experience
        with Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC) programming for industrial
        machines, which sparked my passion for coding. My master electrician
        experience has helped me approach complex problems systematically and
        with an eye for detail.
        <br />
        My software engineering education comes from building projects, taking
        online courses, such as Udemy and Codecademy, and 1-on-1 mentorship from
        MentorCruise.
        <br />
        I&#39;ve also collaborated closely with a designer on all of my
        projects, ensuring that my code meets both functional and aesthetic
        requirements. Currently, I&#39;m seeking a
        <span>front-end or full-stack web development</span> position to utilize
        my skills and make a difference in the field. Explore my website to see
        how I can bring value to your team.
